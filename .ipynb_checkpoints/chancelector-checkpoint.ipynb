      "5 I found this page at random, oddly, and it has lead to some of my more hair-brained ideas, primarily in the realm of optic camouflage. \r\n",
      "Forgive my spelling, if I was meant to be an English teacher, I wouldn't be here. \r\n",
      "When I initially started this idea, there was the typical web search. the results\n",
      "were.... mixed. But there was a recurring theme: how to fool the human visual system. \r\n",
      "Now, it could be argued that perfect camouflage is untraceable on all the entire electromagnetic spectrum, but to be honest, simply achieving invisibility on the visual spectrum is a massive feat in and of itself. So, let's begin:\r\n",
      "Phased Array Optics (PAO): ideally, this is the way to go, but this has a technological limit as this requires a device, miniaturized, that must be constructed in an array that can manipulate and route light around an object. This is similar to the disruption of the pebble in the water, waves ripple and surround the object, movement follows the path around the material. This has been shown to work on the spectrum via John Pendry.\r\n",
      "This has worked on the spectrum tested, but not on the visual spectrum, simply that Pendry's belief in metamaterial is the means to an end, but even Pendry has stated he does not believe true invisibility is acheivable. \r\n",
      "Another method is through optics such as cameras, the \"invisibility cloth\", but that is whack as fuck. Parlor tricks, after all, the goal is true invisibility. \r\n",
      "Another method, before diving in to my low-tech insanity, is to use HASEL muscles with particular nano-crystals, just like an octopus or other cephalopod, and through flex movements, manipulate the light on the skin through textural change. \r\n",
      "Now, on to the meat and potatoes of bat-shit-crazy: LEDs.\r\n",
      "Ideally, using OLED or PLED would be best, but I don't have the means of construction for that nonsense. Instead, I have such novel things as SMD LED 0201, which most likely can't be soldered unless you;'re a savant or nano-bot. These devices can be pre-soldered with wire, but delicacy with always be an issue. \r\n",
      "My idea for a suit is based on the possibility of taking these tiny LEDs and arranging an array for complete active camouflage. \r\n",
      "How so? Well, to answer that, you must first be a masochist.\r\n",
      "Assuming you can utilize LED structures that are 0.65mm x 0.35mm, it would likely take anywhere from 70,00 to 100,000 of these units to cover an entire body. The loss in fidelity could be in that with even a 1080p LED tv, the pixel is about 0.25mm, meaning that you can pack for of those buggers in a 1mm squared space. So we are really doubling over that ability on color with singular parts that are meant to represent one individual color on the spectrum, hoping to cover all the color bases. \r\n",
      "As was once brought up here before, an LED can act as a photodiode, and detect light as well as project. From what I have read, the diode is best suited towards the light it is meant to project, meaning a red LED best detects red on the spectrum. \r\n",
      "With a massive array built into a suit, there is the problem of angle and display, one I fell can be solved with gyroscopic hardware, such that it adjust based on body movement, sending and receiving signals as to where projection needs to occur. If I could add my garbage drawings for this, I would. \r\n",

      "What if instead they had used an anyside up connector? \r\n",
      "What if there was a connector that functioned at the slightest proximity with good data communication and voltage supply to the e-thing?\r\n",
      "There is no such thing\n",
      "You say?  I say use the Plaid Connector (RAIC).\r\n",
      "Ok, just think of two pieces of plaid fabric and a CPU.\r\n",
      "You toss one piece of plaid on the other, and inevitably some of the lines will cross.  You do not know which lines, as you didn't actually lay them on top of each other (connect them) in any particular order.  You just know, geometrically,  some lines on fabric 1 cross likes on fabric 2.\r\n",
      "That's where the CPU comes in.  In looks at (polls) each line on the plaid to see if it has any electricity on it, as compared to all the other plaid lines in serial and parallel.\r\n",
      "Pretty quick (nanoseconds) the 3.6 GHz CPU knows which lines on the plaid are USB data and which lines are voltage.  Then it just aligns what it likes, and Hey!  You've got +/- 5v and some data lines.  \r\n",
      "Don't worry if the thing jiggles, we'll recalculate the plaid identity and find the new +/- 5V and data lines in a few nanoseconds afresh.  In fact, if you are using a slowpoke 2020 USB connection you may not even notice a data interruption (assuming the plaid-resolver can work as fast as a 3.6 GHz CPU).\r\n",
      "But wait! you say.  I've heard of geometry, I've seen plaid.   All those lines overlaying would just short out!\r\n",
      "That;s why instead of plaid you use RAIC (Redundant Array of Independent Conductors); picture the 10x10 times table lots of boxes, each box is a little flat metal nub.  Lay a couple times tables on each other and get the advantages of the plaid conductor, only in working form. \r\n",
      "Also, why stop at just a 10x10 times table.  Why not have a 40x40 times table of little metal nubs and then let the 3.6 GHZ CPU figure out what goes with what.  That's so much redundancy that splitting your +/-5V and data lines over 1600 little metal nubs makes sure something's connected. \r\n",
      "Also, you might be thinking, \"well, I don't know about these little metal nubs\".  Hey! Some of them are kind of convex, and some of them are kind of concave.  No, they don't have to nest, its just likely out of 1600 of them some will protuberate or provide a deep ladle for some other conductor.  actually there's  alot to be said for sinusoidal undulations as well. \r\n",
      "Be sure to wrap some of the 1600 nubs around the sides of the connector as well. Sometimes when you lay two things on each other there is a chance they might warpedly double-convex dish lay together (), skipping most of the allegedly flat part in the middle, but the edge conductors, well, if you are just tosssing thing on thing, gravity makes it so something contacts. If it were a square RAIC thingy (and it could be a circle instead) there would be 160 (4 sides of 40) wrapped-around-the-edge conductors to transmit power and data, even if there was pesky warping.\r\n",
      "explanation:\r\n",
      "So great, going back to plaid, I've tossed two things on each other and they always work.  the CPU resolves what conductor has what thing going on. They are literally just laying there.\r\n",
      "For some technologies just tossing two things on each other  is great.  Conductive phone faceplates doing 40x40 RAIC can just be tossed on another RAIC surface, USB optional/uneccessary, and the phone can recharge and /or do USB things.  From what I read RAIC is imaginably 10 times faster recharging than inductive wireless recharging.  The convenience of just tossing your phone on the pad is still there though.\r\n",
      "But how does it look?  Well, PEDOT is a transparent conductive polymer, and as such you can put it on phone faceplates that have almost any graphic or color on them at the RAIC +/-5v data and USB connector.  \r\n",
      "How about a flash drive? In my life I'm thinking:  Uh-oh the physical metal of the connector is getting a little distorted, will it really last another year or two?  Well, with a RAIC (Redundant Array of Independent Conductors) conductive polymer 40x40 matrix on the outside of the flash drive you can just toss it on a phone charger to rescue the data if the plug-in ceases working.  \r\n",
      "OK, but what if you are mildly sensible, and enjoy that when you plug something in, it is stationary, you know where it is, and even though I say 3.6GHz RAIC conductor finding-out-what's-what (resolution) would handle most USB wiggle changes you have your sights on data communications speeds far higher than USB and 3.6GHZ. \r\n",
      "Basically, let's say you want to plug a device in.  Well you can.  RAIC works great with a dedicated plug.  its got 1600 nubs and CPU resolution.  If it gets bendy it still works.  The 1600 (40x40) conductors can have pretty wide engineering tolerances because of the CPU resolution (finding out what's what) layer.  You don't have to match them.  Once resolved, if stationary because it's a plug, the super high beyond GHz data rates are possible because it omits needing to be re-resolved from interruptive motions.\r\n",
      "Now, what about how it actually works, eh?\r\n",
      "1) I say CPU 3.6 GHz resolution, but when was the last time you heard of a CPU with power transistors in in it.  I haven't heard of such a thing. There could easily be such a thing though.\r\n",
      "That suggests that rather than CPU based \"what's what\" resolution you might make another IC, that can handle power and speed faster than 3.6GHz.  Five picosecond (trillionths of a second) speeds were published in 2020 [link].  I think smarter people would actually put the RAIC resolver on the same computer chip as the e-thing's CPU though as that way you still get the phone-like \"\"hey, I took it apart, it's only got one integrated circuit in it, and it does everything!\", \"Yeah, one chip makes it cheaper to make, dude.\"\r\n",
      "3.6GHz is a 3 nanometer chip feature size speed.  If you make your chips with lots larger features (Or non silicon materials) you can get much higher speeds. Its very old data, but during 2005, 15 years ago, the fastest switching transistor was 604 GHz.  I just read about 2020 switching transistors that work at 5 picoseconds, and support THz ( Trillionth of a second) data activities.  That suggests that a dedicated bit of semiconductor can do RAIC (Redundant Array of Independent Conductors) connection, sorting out what's what (resolution) 100 times faster than 10Gb/second optical internet, possibly resulting in zero data loss even if there is connector wiggling, or purposefully casual \"toss on\" connection.  \r\n",
      "As a mild and enjoyable application, children have toys.  What if you just got an E-towel, and put an e-towel on every toy shelf?  With RAIC all the toys would recharge automatically without any tedious plugging in.  Actual chldren may of course prefer to not quite clean their room, but toss the toys they like onto the part of the floor with the RAIC e-Rug that recharges (regardless of connection). If there's nifty new things the toys are doing with data, the e-Rug does data things with them at Gigabyte speeds.  People wondering about e-rug conductors could look no further than conductive PEDOT, or optically tansparent tin oxide coatings on rug threads of any color. \r\n",
      "An application of RAIC I like:\r\n",
      "Robot hands:  One application of what I really want to call plaid conductors but is actually RAIC is robot hands.  Robots hands with conductor matrices (better than 40x40) perhaps matrices at each fingertip, and at humaniform gynoid robots, each fingertip and toetip, and knuckle, and face feature, in fact the entire robot external body can have invisible/colorized PEDOT interface data communications without plugging anything in utilizing RAIC.  There is a lot to be said for just making the entire surface of the robot be Redundant Array of Independent Conductor (RAIC) covered.  Considering robots, The 5 picosecond \"what's what\" resolution of 2020 transistors is likely to go up a few orders of magnitude more as well.  3D printing with composite conductive polymers is published, so 40x40 RAIC conductors per cm ^2 would be very low resolution.  Transparent conductive polymers like PEDOT are published, and can even be made in different colors. (see note). I think they will create much higher resolution for 3D printed conductive polymers.      \r\n",
      "Note: PEDOT is a transparent conductive polymer.  I glanced at a patent for using purified isotopes that makes optical fibers about 3 orders of magnitude more transparent.  It is possible that using purified single isotopes at PEDOT or other transparent conducting polymers would make them more transparent, more conductive, or both.  That would be great for robots and consumer electronics items.  Deuterium is only 63 cents a gram, I do not know how much single carbon, sulfur, oxygen, and oxygen are.\n",

      "Well, I'm wearing clothes, and I've seen other people do it too.\r\n",
      "There\n",
      "are superhydrophobic (water beads off of) surfaces that water just runs off made with high pitched needles on their surface ||||| [link]. I imagine these either feel like \r\n",
      "Interestingly, the links I have seen do not mention the heights of the needles.  It is possible that with the right polymer (stiff, upright) they could still repel water but be ten times as tall, providing water vapor a chance to evaporate from the skin.  That would avoid the ||||| superhydrophobic polymer (I think woven, but if they can make planar work, ok) perhaps being clammy.\r\n",
      "At the hyperhydrophilic (water clings to) \\__/\\__/ trough array geometry you might get what some natural fibers are said to do, wick away moisture for greater comfort.  So, the question is then, can \\__/\\__/ troughs outperform cotton?  Making cotton obsolete gets a lot of people out of agriculture and into doing some other thing they will like better that is more lucrative, so synthetic fibers that outperform all natural fibers actually support human well being.\r\n",
      "Outperforming cotton could be related to having trough arrays with nontrough channels between the troughs, or even some mixed application where ||||| needles between troughs cause some kind of moisture concentration pattern.  Underwear cotton-replacment microgeometry could be different than shirt cotton replacement geometry.  \r\n",
      "I think the patents on goretex have expired.  Goretex might uses micropore traversing a slick polymer that water runs off of, but water vapor escapes through the pores keeping the person unhumid, noncondensating, and dry.  Similar material, a vapor barrier is also used to wrap houses with (keeps out water, lets out water vapor).  This could combine in slightly new ways with the troughs and needles.\r\n",
      "If the troughs have High rims, that it is like a bunch of hollows with sort of \"tall bollards\" between them, then the amount of actual skin-to-surface (woven/planar) contact between the person and their shirt could be very miniscule.  Like the outer perimeter of 10x10 times table as the tall rim is the only thing that touches the skin.  But, because these rims are on troughs, if there is any liquid water it adheres (wets) the troughs, which I think could also have wiking-away channels at its geometry.  As a wearing sensation this might feel very dry even if perspiring.  It might even feel very dry if soaked with water (the rims extend above the wetness of the troughs.\r\n",
      "So, I suppose along with the material itself, a new kind of diaper fabric is the .5B idea:  Laser-produced microtextured diaper surfaces with hydrophilic troughs having high rims that extend above the troughs.  As a diaper this would keep babies dryer feeling, which I think they like.\r\n",
      "High rim trough geometries also work on athleticwear of course, and could just be extra  comfy warm weather shirting that is better than cotton.\r\n",
      "Making trough and needle geometry fabrics cheaply:  Thread: having say an octagon shaped optical chamber surrounding the single vertically passing thread with a rapidly pulsed laser field microengraves troughs and needles into it.  There is another possibility, and that is \"hot melt impressing\" where microengraving-patterned rollers simply roll on the thread (or have the moving thread pass through the rollers) to make the needles and troughs.\r\n",
      "Hot melt impressing might actually work really well and be very extra cheap.  Lasers might be better through as the rollers (molds) don't exist to get dirty, and there are fewer moving parts, and, one I like a lot, you can change the geometry identity instantly at any particular batch at the thread factory (flexible manufacturing).  Switch not just from needles to troughs with no moving parts, but to troughs with goretex pores in the bases.  \r\n",
      "Also, lasers have the advantage of being able to work very well at engraving different materials.  I think microengraving with actual contact hot melt rollers could not flexibly switch from one kind of polymer (different melt temperature) to another without intervention.  I think lasers might be able to adapt their engraving to any polymer filament (thread) with just software. \r\n",
      "If the microneedles are actually needles on a \"spiky collander\" Then  you get even greater dirt and water repellency than goretex, but noting this is a laser treatment on anything from individual threads to planar surfaces it could be very cheap.    \r\n",
      "Making the diapers is kind of interesting because my perception is that disposable diapers are sort of like felt or oriented-strand board, not woven like a fabric weave at all, but definitely different than say a planar sheet of cling-wrap.  So, wherever they get the microfibers they press into felt for diapers they could laser microengrave the microfibers with high sided (rim/bollard) trough arrays that wick liquid but have super minimal skin contact area and feel dry to the touch.\r\n",
      "You can also laser engrave the microgeometry on the felt, pre-diaper.  At some giant factory where diaper making felt is traversing in 3 meter wide swaths on 3 meter sized rollers a laser above the roller that looks like a long [                            ] hoizontal tetris piece is busy zapping/microengraving the felt.  One laser above the felt and one below should work, they might even have different patterns.  \r\n",
      "Regarding babies and diapers there is an interesting opportunity to go from building something you think babies want to finding out what babies actually like and makes them measurably (quantifiably even) smile more and cry less.  \r\n",
      "Laser microengraved diaper lining fabric is a big opportunity for that because the microengraving can make a really wide variety of effects.  Maybe hypervelvet softness with zero tolerance for liquid moisture is great on leg perimeters and gathers.  Perhaps babies are actually really into gore-tex like general humidity decrease when unsoiled.  Maybe they like Angora-sweater texture that wicks away moisture to always stay dry.  Diaper experts could try hundreds of variations and qualitatively measure the amount of smiles and the lack of crying.  They could even measure the number of times a baby awakens during the night, and the amount the baby cries during he night to see if diaper variations can reduce night awakenings and night crying. Laser microengraving makes the diaper products that babies like best cheap and affordable.\r\n",

      "Addressing a caution:  Needle and trough microsurfaces are pretty well known, and I'm not aware of any people or companies that made a billion dollar application out of them. Perhaps car windshields or bridge paint are things I read about.  I think the difference here is that the microengraved fabrics are also basically disposable.  From the extreme of diapers to everyone just sort of expecting a pair of socks to be not-so-new after 40 washes the temporariness of fabric could make up for the possibility of the microengraving to wear off.\r\n",
      "Side application:  Better bandages, band-aids and surgical dressings:\r\n",
      "They talk about wet and dry dressings in medicine.  I do not know which is better, or what the various forms are used for.  With microengraved troughs or needles, noting that with 11 times height needles skin can breathe (that is vapor can drift away) even if there are roll-around beads of fluid atop the needles.  Also noting, that with high rim/bollards at the sides of troughs you can customize amount of actual skin-to-fabric contact from say 1-100% contact I think laser microengraved bandages could really benefit people.\n",

      "Millifiore beads [link] take \"chub\" sized glass, roll it thin, layer different color tubes together, roll it again, and repeat a number of times.  Diameters of micrometers or smaller features are possible.  So, instead of colored glass, you just have millifiore tube art made out of cold polymer that will foam when you raise the temperature and the solvent boils/puffs up the polymer.  Then you UV cure the polymer while it is puffed up (in its genetic algorithm optimized topography), or you just know things about polymers and know that when you warm it up the free radical polymerization (epoxy-like) chemistry will just make the very highly customized foam semirigid.  \r\n",

      "5 I favor eugenics as well as genetically engineering human beings (Homo sapiens) to be much more intelligent, kinder, long lived, and beautiful than they are now (2020 AD).\r\n",
      "But, you ask, what am I going to do about it?\r\n",
      "Well, using spam software, advertising and SEO (Search engine optimization) I\n",
      "could reach out to the 99th percentile of wonderfulness out there and teach them how to get lots, like 7-20 times more live meetup dates via online personals.  \r\n",
      "Further, I could emphasize things at the semi-automated dating scripts they modify and use that also attract people that like to have large families.  John Von Neumann, Meet Marie Osmond!\r\n",
      "Then, because some of it runs through my online presence, I can quantify how many more millions of genetically advantaged babies have been born from my software project worldwide.  The internet says 32 million people are listed in US online personals, and that 30% of people have used an online personals ad at some time.  Globally, if people at the developing world are using the phones with dating apps that suggests a 2.1 billion person opportunity.  Otherwise, if its just PCs its about 1 billion people.\r\n",
      "I'd probably have to figure out what I was doing, but if you just match the 99th percentile of wonderfulness with the 98th percentile of wonderfulness, 2% of a billion people is 20 million people in a eugenics favored romance.  Optimistically if they have 3.5 children then that causes 35 million genetically advantaged children.\r\n",
      "There's also room for math and a computer simulation.  If I were a high quality eugenicist I would actually have a preference for particular named genes, alleles, and epigenetics.   A computer simulation could tell me if coming from a large family is more effective at spreading beneficial genes than 99th percentile + 98th percentile matches.  \r\n",
      "So, of course, I would then build custom content and email for different computer-perceived genetic optima.  The 99th percentile gets different dating site SEO automation than the 80th percentile.  \r\n",
      "How does the computer link the person to their genetics using only online content?  With mass-processsing of personals site data, their findable social networking text (facebook), and anything the computer plausibly thinks they wrote (or imaged).  The text is then numerically linked (correlated) to the psychometric called the big 5.  Each of the big five factors has been repeatedly published as about 50% due to genetics.  I think it is more than that.  \r\n",

      "- use more than the absolute minimum of site bandwidth for your task. This means no ripping the entire site to your computing device and then searching it locally. \r\n",
      "- generate excessive new HB threads. You must either annotate an existing thread, or if you do create a new thread you must delete all previous ones. \r\n",

      "- Send heavy naval units through the Denmark Strait without destroyer escort or air cover, or sink any British battlecruisers. \r\n",
      "- use an existing search engine. Those doing so will be summarily shot without trial, and then hung up outside a garage in Milan. \r\n",
      "- request, conscript or coerce any assistance from any other person, organization or nation, including but not limited to Austria, Italy, Hungary or Romania. The code must be all your own work.\r\n",
      "- register a new HB username to spare yourself embarrassment and ridicule. \n",

      "You should try to avoid :\r\n",
      "- using anything other than the existing HB \"search\" facility.\r\n",
      "- overly provoking the U.S. unless absolutely necessary, unavoidable, accidental, funny, because the smug isolationist gits deserve it (being perfectly happy to let someone else do all the actual fighting while making silly money from loans and selling munitions at a swingeing profit), or you* just can't help yourself. \r\n",
      "(*This condition is of course waived those of Japanese nationality).\r\n",
      "- bombing any neutral countries (except the Republic of Ireland, who deserve whatever they get for not helping).\n",

      "You MUST:\r\n",
      "- reliably spot and log any new occurrences of the name; you must ignore previous mentions or edited annotations. You must weed out misspellings and deliberate attempts to deceive the algorithm, but the code must not be case sensitive.\r\n",
      "- demonstrate kindness and consideration for dogs, particularly German Shepherds.\r\n",
      "- handle month and year-ends and other date and time rollovers (including leap years) cleanly and correctly. \r\n",
      "- use your own existing username and do your testing and debugging \"in public\" to furnish copious opportunities for derision and mockery. If you fail, you must be seen to fail. Badly, repeatedly, and in a humiliating way.\r\n",
      "- respect the Geneva Conventions.\r\n",
      "- only log the latest occurrence on any particular day, but this can be dependent on the time zone in which the user's machine resides.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Other rules:\r\n",
      "You may use any device, operating system, programming tool, language, link library, SDK, web interface, browser, device driver or other legitimate general purpose device or system.  \r\n",
      "You will not be expected to publish your code, but you may be asked to send a copy to at least one other HB user to verify that you’re not just doing the edits manually. \r\n",
      "Points will be deducted for date rollover issues, bad formatting, truncated or corrupted usernames or thread names, or getting the Sixth Army surrounded at Stalingrad and captured en masse.\r\n",
      "Your code does not have to provide links to the thread, or line numbers containing the mention, but this may earn extra Luftflotten if implemented in a neat and consistent way.\n",

      "Judging.\r\n",
      "The contest will end on 31 December 2020, or when Russian troops reach the Reichstag.\r\n",

      "The losers get a conducted tour of a restored WW2 bunker in Berlin, and then have to go into a small private room and shoot themselves with a small-calibre pistol. Their bodies will then be taken outside and burnt (allegedly). When they reach Argentina, they should delete their old HB account and register a new username. \r\n",

But there was a recurring theme: how to fool the human visual system. \\r\\nNow, it could be argued that perfect camouflage is untraceable on all the entire electromagnetic spectrum, but to be honest, simply achieving invisibility on the visual spectrum is a massive feat in and of itself. So, let\\'s begin:\\r\\nPhased Array Optics (PAO): ideally, this is the way to go, but this has a technological limit as this requires a device, miniaturized, that must be constructed in an array that can manipulate and route light around an object. This is similar to the disruption of the pebble in the water, waves ripple and surround the object, movement follows the path around the material. This has been shown to work on the spectrum via John Pendry.\\r\\nThis has worked on the spectrum tested, but not on the visual spectrum, simply that Pendry\\'s belief in metamaterial is the means to an end, but even Pendry has stated he does not believe true invisibility is acheivable. \\r\\nAnother method is through optics such as cameras, the \"invisibility cloth\", but that is whack as fuck. Parlor tricks, after all, the goal is true invisibility. \\r\\nAnother method, before diving in to my low-tech insanity, is to use HASEL muscles with particular nano-crystals, just like an octopus or other cephalopod, and through flex movements, manipulate the light on the skin through textural change. \\r\\nNow, on to the meat and potatoes of bat-shit-crazy: LEDs.\\r\\nIdeally, using OLED or PLED would be best, but I don\\'t have the means of construction for that nonsense. Instead, I have such novel things as SMD LED 0201, which most likely can\\'t be soldered unless you;\\'re a savant or nano-bot. These devices can be pre-soldered with wire, but delicacy with always be an issue. \\r\\nMy idea for a suit is based on the possibility of taking these tiny LEDs and arranging an array for complete active camouflage. \\r\\nHow so? Well, to answer that, you must first be a masochist.\\r\\nAssuming you can utilize LED structures that are 0.65mm x 0.35mm, it would likely take anywhere from 70,00 to 100,000 of these units to cover an entire body. The loss in fidelity could be in that with even a 1080p LED tv, the pixel is about 0.25mm, meaning that you can pack for of those buggers in a 1mm squared space. So we are really doubling over that ability on color with singular parts that are meant to represent one individual color on the spectrum, hoping to cover all the color bases. \\r\\nAs was once brought up here before, an LED can act as a photodiode, and detect light as well as project. From what I have read, the diode is best suited towards the light it is meant to project, meaning a red LED best detects red on the spectrum. \\r\\nWith a massive array built into a suit, there is the problem of angle and display, one I fell can be solved with gyroscopic hardware, such that it adjust based on body movement, sending and receiving signals as to where projection needs to occur. If I could add my garbage drawings for this, I would. \\r\\nSo, drunk rant complete.

They can keep all their signals and power straight and separate from one onother.

I say use the Plaid Connector (RAIC).\\r\\nOk, just think of two pieces of plaid fabric and a CPU.\\r\\nYou toss one piece of plaid on the other, and inevitably some of the lines will cross.  You do not know which lines, as you didn\\'t actually lay them on top of each other (connect them) in any particular order.  You just know, geometrically,  some lines on fabric 1 cross likes on fabric 2.\\r\\nThat\\'s where the CPU comes in.  In looks at (polls) each line on the plaid to see if it has any electricity on it, as compared to all the other plaid lines in serial and parallel.\\r\\nPretty quick (nanoseconds) the 3.6 GHz CPU knows which lines on the plaid are USB data and which lines are voltage.  Then it just aligns what it likes, and Hey!  You\\'ve got +/- 5v and some data lines.  \\r\\nDon\\'t worry if the thing jiggles, we\\'ll recalculate the plaid identity and find the new +/- 5V and data lines in a few nanoseconds afresh.  In fact, if you are using a slowpoke 2020 USB connection you may not even notice a data interruption (assuming the plaid-resolver can work as fast as a 3.6 GHz CPU).\\r\\nBut wait! you say.  I\\'ve heard of geometry, I\\'ve seen plaid.   All those lines overlaying would just short out!\\r\\nThat;s why instead of plaid you use RAIC (Redundant Array of Independent Conductors); picture the 10x10 times table lots of boxes, each box is a little flat metal nub.  Lay a couple times tables on each other and get the advantages of the plaid conductor, only in working form. \\r\\nAlso, why stop at just a 10x10 times table.  Why not have a 40x40 times table of little metal nubs and then let the 3.6 GHZ CPU figure out what goes with what.  That\\'s so much redundancy that splitting your +/-5V and data lines over 1600 little metal nubs makes sure something\\'s connected. \\r\\nAlso, you might be thinking, \"well, I don\\'t know about these little metal nubs\".  Hey! Some of them are kind of convex, and some of them are kind of concave.  No, they don\\'t have to nest, its just likely out of 1600 of them some will protuberate or provide a deep ladle for some other conductor.  actually there\\'s  alot to be said for sinusoidal undulations as well. \\r\\nBe sure to wrap some of the 1600 nubs around the sides of the connector as well. Sometimes when you lay two things on each other there is a chance they might warpedly double-convex dish lay together (), skipping most of the allegedly flat part in the middle, but the edge conductors, well, if you are just tosssing thing on thing, gravity makes it so something contacts. If it were a square RAIC thingy (and it could be a circle instead) there would be 160 (4 sides of 40) wrapped-around-the-edge conductors to transmit power and data, even if there was pesky warping.\\r\\nexplanation:\\r\\nSo great, going back to plaid, I\\'ve tossed two things on each other and they always work.  the CPU resolves what conductor has what thing going on. They are literally just laying there.\\r\\nFor some technologies just tossing two things on each other  is great.  Conductive phone faceplates doing 40x40 RAIC can just be tossed on another RAIC surface, USB optional/uneccessary, and the phone can recharge and /or do USB things.  From what I read RAIC is imaginably 10 times faster recharging than inductive wireless recharging.  The convenience of just tossing your phone on the pad is still there though.\\r\\nBut how does it look?  Well, PEDOT is a transparent conductive polymer, and as such you can put it on phone faceplates that have almost any graphic or color on them at the RAIC +/-5v data and USB connector.  \\r\\nHow about a flash drive? In my life I\\'m thinking:  Uh-oh the physical metal of the connector is getting a little distorted, will it really last another year or two?  Well, with a RAIC (Redundant Array of Independent Conductors) conductive polymer 40x40 matrix on the outside of the flash drive you can just toss it on a phone charger to rescue the data if the plug-in ceases working.  \\r\\nOK, but what if you are mildly sensible, and enjoy that when you plug something in, it is stationary, you know where it is, and even though I say 3.6GHz RAIC conductor finding-out-what\\'s-what (resolution) would handle most USB wiggle changes you have your sights on data communications speeds far higher than USB and 3.6GHZ. \\r\\nBasically, let\\'s say you want to plug a device in.  Well you can.  RAIC works great with a dedicated plug.  its got 1600 nubs and CPU resolution.  If it gets bendy it still works.  The 1600 (40x40) conductors can have pretty wide engineering tolerances because of the CPU resolution (finding out what\\'s what) layer.  You don\\'t have to match them.  Once resolved, if stationary because it\\'s a plug, the super high beyond GHz data rates are possible because it omits needing to be re-resolved from interruptive motions.\\r\\nNow, what about how it actually works, eh?\\r\\n1) I say CPU 3.6 GHz resolution, but when was the last time you heard of a CPU with power transistors in in it.  I haven\\'t heard of such a thing. There could easily be such a thing though.\\r\\nThat suggests that rather than CPU based \"what\\'s what\" resolution you might make another IC, that can handle power and speed faster than 3.6GHz.  Five picosecond (trillionths of a second) speeds were published in 2020 [link].  I think smarter people would actually put the RAIC resolver on the same computer chip as the e-thing\\'s CPU though as that way you still get the phone-like \"\"hey, I took it apart, it\\'s only got one integrated circuit in it, and it does everything!\", \"Yeah, one chip makes it cheaper to make, dude.\"\\r\\n3.6GHz is a 3 nanometer chip feature size speed.  If you make your chips with lots larger features (Or non silicon materials) you can get much higher speeds. Its very old data, but during 2005, 15 years ago, the fastest switching transistor was 604 GHz.  I just read about 2020 switching transistors that work at 5 picoseconds, and support THz ( Trillionth of a second) data activities.  That suggests that a dedicated bit of semiconductor can do RAIC (Redundant Array of Independent Conductors) connection, sorting out what\\'s what (resolution) 100 times faster than 10Gb/second optical internet, possibly resulting in zero data loss even if there is connector wiggling, or purposefully casual \"toss on\" connection.  \\r\\nAs a mild and enjoyable application, children have toys.  What if you just got an E-towel, and put an e-towel on every toy shelf?  With RAIC all the toys would recharge automatically without any tedious plugging in.  Actual chldren may of course prefer to not quite clean their room, but toss the toys they like onto the part of the floor with the RAIC e-Rug that recharges (regardless of connection). If there\\'s nifty new things the toys are doing with data, the e-Rug does data things with them at Gigabyte speeds.  People wondering about e-rug conductors could look no further than conductive PEDOT, or optically tansparent tin oxide coatings on rug threads of any color. \\r\\nAn application of RAIC I like:\\r\\nRobot hands:  One application of what I really want to call plaid conductors but is actually RAIC is robot hands.  Robots hands with conductor matrices (better than 40x40) perhaps matrices at each fingertip, and at humaniform gynoid robots, each fingertip and toetip, and knuckle, and face feature, in fact the entire robot external body can have invisible/colorized PEDOT interface data communications without plugging anything in utilizing RAIC.  There is a lot to be said for just making the entire surface of the robot be Redundant Array of Independent Conductor (RAIC) covered.  Considering robots, The 5 picosecond \"what\\'s what\" resolution of 2020 transistors is likely to go up a few orders of magnitude more as well.  3D printing with composite conductive polymers is published, so 40x40 RAIC conductors per cm ^2 would be very low resolution.  Transparent conductive polymers like PEDOT are published, and can even be made in different colors. (see note). I think they will create much higher resolution for 3D printed conductive polymers.      \\r\\nNote: PEDOT is a transparent conductive polymer.  I glanced at a patent for using purified isotopes that makes optical fibers about 3 orders of magnitude more transparent.  It is possible that using purified single isotopes at PEDOT or other transparent conducting polymers would make them more transparent, more conductive, or both.  That would be great for robots and consumer electronics items.

I imagine these either feel like \\r\\nInterestingly, the links I have seen do not mention the heights of the needles.  It is possible that with the right polymer (stiff, upright) they could still repel water but be ten times as tall, providing water vapor a chance to evaporate from the skin.  That would avoid the ||||| superhydrophobic polymer (I think woven, but if they can make planar work, ok) perhaps being clammy.\\r\\nAt the hyperhydrophilic (water clings to) \\\\__/\\\\__/ trough array geometry you might get what some natural fibers are said to do, wick away moisture for greater comfort.  So, the question is then, can \\\\__/\\\\__/ troughs outperform cotton?  Making cotton obsolete gets a lot of people out of agriculture and into doing some other thing they will like better that is more lucrative, so synthetic fibers that outperform all natural fibers actually support human well being.\\r\\nOutperforming cotton could be related to having trough arrays with nontrough channels between the troughs, or even some mixed application where ||||| needles between troughs cause some kind of moisture concentration pattern.  Underwear cotton-replacment microgeometry could be different than shirt cotton replacement geometry.  \\r\\nI think the patents on goretex have expired.  Goretex might uses micropore traversing a slick polymer that water runs off of, but water vapor escapes through the pores keeping the person unhumid, noncondensating, and dry.  Similar material, a vapor barrier is also used to wrap houses with (keeps out water, lets out water vapor).  This could combine in slightly new ways with the troughs and needles.\\r\\nIf the troughs have High rims, that it is like a bunch of hollows with sort of \"tall bollards\" between them, then the amount of actual skin-to-surface (woven/planar) contact between the person and their shirt could be very miniscule.  Like the outer perimeter of 10x10 times table as the tall rim is the only thing that touches the skin.  But, because these rims are on troughs, if there is any liquid water it adheres (wets) the troughs, which I think could also have wiking-away channels at its geometry.  As a wearing sensation this might feel very dry even if perspiring.  It might even feel very dry if soaked with water (the rims extend above the wetness of the troughs.\\r\\nSo, I suppose along with the material itself, a new kind of diaper fabric is the .5B idea:  Laser-produced microtextured diaper surfaces with hydrophilic troughs having high rims that extend above the troughs.  As a diaper this would keep babies dryer feeling, which I think they like.\\r\\nHigh rim trough geometries also work on athleticwear of course, and could just be extra  comfy warm weather shirting that is better than cotton.\\r\\nMaking trough and needle geometry fabrics cheaply:  Thread: having say an octagon shaped optical chamber surrounding the single vertically passing thread with a rapidly pulsed laser field microengraves troughs and needles into it.  There is another possibility, and that is \"hot melt impressing\" where microengraving-patterned rollers simply roll on the thread (or have the moving thread pass through the rollers) to make the needles and troughs.\\r\\nHot melt impressing might actually work really well and be very extra cheap.  Lasers might be better through as the rollers (molds) don\\'t exist to get dirty, and there are fewer moving parts, and, one I like a lot, you can change the geometry identity instantly at any particular batch at the thread factory (flexible manufacturing).  Switch not just from needles to troughs with no moving parts, but to troughs with goretex pores in the bases.  \\r\\nAlso, lasers have the advantage of being able to work very well at engraving different materials.  I think microengraving with actual contact hot melt rollers could not flexibly switch from one kind of polymer (different melt temperature) to another without intervention.  I think lasers might be able to adapt their engraving to any polymer filament (thread) with just software. \\r\\nIf the microneedles are actually needles on a \"spiky collander\" Then  you get even greater dirt and water repellency than goretex, but noting this is a laser treatment on anything from individual threads to planar surfaces it could be very cheap.    \\r\\nMaking the diapers is kind of interesting because my perception is that disposable diapers are sort of like felt or oriented-strand board, not woven like a fabric weave at all, but definitely different than say a planar sheet of cling-wrap.  So, wherever they get the microfibers they press into felt for diapers they could laser microengrave the microfibers with high sided (rim/bollard) trough arrays that wick liquid but have super minimal skin contact area and feel dry to the touch.\\r\\nYou can also laser engrave the microgeometry on the felt, pre-diaper.  At some giant factory where diaper making felt is traversing in 3 meter wide swaths on 3 meter sized rollers a laser above the roller that looks like a long [                            ] hoizontal tetris piece is busy zapping/microengraving the felt.  One laser above the felt and one below should work, they might even have different patterns.  \\r\\nRegarding babies and diapers there is an interesting opportunity to go from building something you think babies want to finding out what babies actually like and makes them measurably (quantifiably even) smile more and cry less.  \\r\\nLaser microengraved diaper lining fabric is a big opportunity for that because the microengraving can make a really wide variety of effects.  Maybe hypervelvet softness with zero tolerance for liquid moisture is great on leg perimeters and gathers.  Perhaps babies are actually really into gore-tex like general humidity decrease when unsoiled.  Maybe they like Angora-sweater texture that wicks away moisture to always stay dry.  Diaper experts could try hundreds of variations and qualitatively measure the amount of smiles and the lack of crying.  They could even measure the number of times a baby awakens during the night, and the amount the baby cries during he night to see if diaper variations can reduce night awakenings and night crying. Laser microengraving makes the diaper products that babies like best cheap and affordable.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso |||| (superhydrophobic needle geometry} socks likely repel dirt naturally. \\r\\nAddressing a caution:  Needle and trough microsurfaces are pretty well known, and I\\'m not aware of any people or companies that made a billion dollar application out of them. Perhaps car windshields or bridge paint are things I read about.  I think the difference here is that the microengraved fabrics are also basically disposable.  From the extreme of diapers to everyone just sort of expecting a pair of socks to be not-so-new after 40 washes the temporariness of fabric could make up for the possibility of the microengraving to wear off.\\r\\nSide application:  Better bandages, band-aids and surgical dressings:\\r\\nThey talk about wet and dry dressings in medicine.  I do not know which is better, or what the various forms are used for.  With microengraved troughs or needles, noting that with 11 times height needles skin can breathe (that is vapor can drift away) even if there are roll-around beads of fluid atop the needles.  Also noting, that with high rim/bollards at the sides of troughs you can customize amount of actual skin-to-fabric contact from say 1-100% contact I think laser microengraved bandages could really benefit people.'), ('user', 'beanangel'), ('idea_date', 1608163200), ('fetch_date', 1608208494.678206)]\n",

So, instead of colored glass, you just have millifiore tube art made out of cold polymer that will foam when you raise the temperature and the solvent boils/puffs up the polymer.
